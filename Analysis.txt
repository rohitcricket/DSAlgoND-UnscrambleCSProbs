Big O Notation:

Task 0:
Time: O(1) -> The access time is constant time since you are accessing them via an index and not looping over the entire record.
Space: O(1) -> I didn't create a new list of n records.

Task 1:
Time: O(n) -> The Big O is of O(n), i.e., order of n as we are looping over n. 
Space: O(n) -> I created a new set and added elements in the for loop.

Task 2:
Time: O(n) -> The Big O is of O(n), i.e., order of n as we are looping over n.
Space: O(n) -> I created a new datastructure, a dictionary which is of order n.

Task 3:
Time: O(nlogn) -> Both part A and B are O(n) as there is only one for loop. And for sorting, I used the sorted function which is O(nlog(n)).
Space: O(n) -> I created a new set.

Task 4:
Time: O(nlogn) -> We are looping over n a couple of times. And for sorting, I used the sorted function which is O(nlog(n))
Space: O(n) -> I created a few new arrays of order n.
